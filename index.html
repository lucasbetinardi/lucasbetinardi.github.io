      <h2>Architecture</h2>
      <p>
        Architecture was for me the opportunity to start to understand the real meaning of design and creativity. I'm in my third year and I'm looking forward to learn more about everything related to it.

      <h2>Photography</h2>
      <p>
        Taking photos has been my hobbie for a long time. I've learned that photography is intimately related to Architecture, and that has been an eye-opener leading me to take better pictures.  Check my <a href="http://instagram.com/lucasbet">Instagram</a>!

      <h2>Design</h2>
      <p>
        Design is what really moves me. Product, graphic and web design covers what I've been excited to work on since I was a kid. Architecture is related to a little bit of all of that, and that is why it was my choice. Now I started to move forward to more specific topics, such as Web Design or Robotics ides, to improve my skills and open more branches on what can I do regarding Design.

      <h2>Technology</h2>
      <p>
        Yes, I'm a technology addict. I love reading about it everyday, all the time. I believe that a good experience with technology products goes beyond the software itself; it is the meticulously crafted relation between the software and the hardware that really matters to the user. That is why I'm passionate about Apple and I have the desire to one day develop for its platform.
