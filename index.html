  <p>
    Hey! I am from <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Maringa">Maringá, Brazil</a> and I am studying Architecture at <a href="http://iit.edu/">IIT</a>, in Chicago, IL. I love everything that is related to technology and design, and I am looking forward to learning more about web and iOS development.

    <li class="architecture">
      <h2>Architecture</h2>
      <p>
        Architecture was for me the opportunity to start to understand the real meaning of design and creativity. I'm in the third year and I'm looking forward to learn more about everything related to it.

    <li class="photography">
      <h2>Photography</h2>
      <p>
        Taking photos has been my hobbie for a long time. I learned that Photography is intimate related to Architecture, and that helped me to open my eyes and take better pictures.

    <li class="design">
      <h2>Design</h2>
      <p>
        Design is what really moves me. Product, Graphic and Web Design covers what I'm exited to work on since I was a kid. Architecture is related to a little bit of all of that, and that is why I chose it. Now I started to move forward to more specific topics, such as Web Design or Robotics classes, to improve my skills and open more branches on what can I do related to Design.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li class="technology">
      <h2>Technology</h2>
      <p>
        Yes, I'm a technology addicted. I love reading about it everyday, everytime. I believe that a good experience with technology products go beyond the actual software, to the connection between it and the hardware. That is why I'm passioned about Apple and I have the desire to one day develop for its platform.
